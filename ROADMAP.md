# Big Data Processing with EMR - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview Mindmap

The following mindmap provides a visual overview of the project components and their relationships:

This mindmap illustrates the key components of the project, including data sources, processing steps, AWS services, and business insights.

## Technical Terms Explained

### AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce)

EMR is a cloud-based big data platform that allows you to process vast amounts of data using popular frameworks like Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Presto. It automatically provisions and scales compute resources, making it easier to process large datasets without managing the underlying infrastructure.

### Apache Spark

A unified analytics engine for big data processing with built-in modules for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. We'll use PySpark (Python API for Spark) to write our data transformation jobs.

### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. We'll use S3 to store both our raw data and processed results.

### AWS Glue

A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics. Glue Crawlers automatically discover and catalog metadata from data sources, making the data available for querying.

### Amazon Athena

An interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It's serverless, so there's no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries you run.

### AWS Step Functions

A serverless workflow orchestration service that lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. We'll use it to automate our entire data pipeline.

### Parquet Format

A columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk.

## Project Requirements

1. **Data Processing Infrastructure**:
   - Set up EMR cluster with Spark
   - Configure appropriate IAM roles and permissions
   - Establish S3 buckets for data storage

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Process raw datasets (vehicles, users, locations, rental transactions)
   - Calculate business metrics (revenue, transaction counts, etc.)
   - Transform data into optimized formats (Parquet)

3. **Data Cataloging and Analysis**:
   - Set up Glue Crawlers to catalog processed data
   - Configure Athena for SQL-based analysis
   - Create sample queries for business insights

4. **Workflow Automation**:
   - Create Step Functions workflow to orchestrate the entire process
   - Automate EMR cluster creation, job execution, and termination
   - Trigger Glue Crawlers automatically after data processing

5. **Documentation and Best Practices**:
   - Document all code with comprehensive comments
   - Follow AWS best practices for security and cost optimization
   - Create clear instructions for running and maintaining the pipeline

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement this project in phases:

1. **Setup Phase**: Create project structure, set up AWS credentials, and prepare development environment
2. **Development Phase**: Create Spark jobs and test them locally
3. **Deployment Phase**: Deploy to AWS, run on EMR, and set up Glue/Athena
4. **Automation Phase**: Implement Step Functions workflow
5. **Documentation Phase**: Complete all documentation and finalize the project

Throughout the project, we'll use Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and testing when appropriate.
